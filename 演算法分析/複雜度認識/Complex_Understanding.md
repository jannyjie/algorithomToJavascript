## What is Complexity?
* When analyzing the complexity of an algorithm, we calculate the (time or space) complexity.
* Generally. every addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, comparison counts as one "operation".
* Complexity meats given an input size, "how many operations do we need to perform in an algorithm?"
* We use function f(n) to show the wquation of complexity and input sizes.
