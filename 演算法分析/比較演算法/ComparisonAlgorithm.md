## Time and Space are the concerns
* We care about how n=much time it takes for an algorithm to finish a tak. The less time it takes, the better it is.
* Timeing our code's runtime is not realistic in terms of analysis. Why?
    1. Same computer gets different runtime for the same task.
    2. Different computing power machine giver different run time for the amse task.
