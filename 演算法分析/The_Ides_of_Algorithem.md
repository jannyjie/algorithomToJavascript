# What is Algorithm? 
1. Algorthm is a finite sequence of well-defind,computer-implementsble instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.

2. Easily speaking, algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.

## Examples of Algorithm in real life
1. How does Google Map find the shortest path?
2. How does YouTube know what vides you might want to watch, from 5 billion videos?
3. How does excel sheet sort ypur financial statements in either descending order or ascending order?
4. How does Facebook/Instagram know what friends you should add ?
5. More...

## 分析演算法
Is it important to compare algorithme?
If two different algorithms can accomplish the same task, then why do we care about which one is better?


## 如何判別好的演算法
1. 演算法數度快
2. 占用電腦記憶體資源少
